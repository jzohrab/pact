# User-specific plugins.

You can write and put your own plugins here, or copy them from
`pact/plugins` as needed.

When referring to them in the config.ini file, use the full path
without the extension, with the file separators replaced with `.`.

For example: `./myplugins/sample.py` becomes `myplugins.sample`

Note: this entire directory is ignored by git, except for this README.md.
