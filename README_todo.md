* some kind of status update on export, "success" or similar.
* if exporting on thread, then gui update shouldn't cause seg fault.
* save the exported date with the clip
* if already exported, ask if want to re-export
* on bookmark, automatically set clip start and end to nearest 'silent times' (if any found and within reasonable range)
* add "export all" button on main form to export anything not already exported.  Would need status feedback/window, pass/fail indication in bookmark list, and reporting on failures.
